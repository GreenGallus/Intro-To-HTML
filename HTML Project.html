				<br>
			<b><em>1. Procedural Thinking</b></em>
			<p>Procedural thinking involves creating perfectly clear and unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow.
				<br>
			It may be easy to tell a person how to sort a deck of cards, but getting a computer to do that requires more thought. But once you've learned to think this way you'll find that computers can do it much faster.</p>
				<br>
			<b><em>2. Abstract Thinking</b></em>
			<p>Abstract thinking means finding similarity, or as programmers would say, generality amongst seemingly different things.
				<br>
			In this Nanodegree program you will visit hundreds of Udacity web pages. It would be impractical for a programmer to specifically program each of these pages individually. The Udacity programmers used the power of what's called abstraction to avoid unnecessary repetition of work.</p>
				<br>
			<b><em>3. Systems Thinking</b></em>
			<p>Systems thinking happens when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces. Programmers do this when they create a plan (often on paper) for how a program will work. It involves big-picture thinking and decision-making about a problem and how different pieces of a program can work together to solve it. If this is unclear now, don't worry! You'll understand what this means much more clearly by the end of the Nanodegree program.</p>
			<br>
			<b><em>4. Technological Empathy</b></em>
			<p>"Technological empathy" comes in many forms. For example, computer empathy is the ability to understand what a computer is, how it works, and what it's good and bad at doing.
				<br>
			A computer is a tool, as are the programs we use and the programming languages used to write them. It's almost impossible to program anything substantial without a basic understanding of how these tools work.</p>
				<br>
			<b><em>5. Debugging</b></em>
			<p>Debugging is a systematic process of relentlessly identifying the cause of a computer program that doesn't work.
				<br>
			When a program doesn't work, it's because there is a mistake (also known as a <span style=background-color:yellow>"bug"</span>) somewhere in the computer code. Since these mistakes are an unavoidable part of programming, every good programmer has a system for fixing them and that system usually looks something like this:
				<br>
				<br>
			<em>
			1.	Collect evidence (what makes this program fail?)
				<br>
			2.	Generate theories (what may have caused this problem?)
				<br>
			3.	Test those theories (if my theory is correct, how could I find out?)
				<br>
			4.	Fix the problem</p>
			</em>
